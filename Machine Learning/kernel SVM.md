## Kernel SVM
Kernel SVM is used when the data points in a dataset are not linearly separable:

Kernel SVM applies mapping to a Higher-Dimensional Space, which can be highly compute-intensive. To avoid this a Kernel 
Trick is performed.

Types of Kernel Functions:
- Gayssuan RBF Kernel
- Sigmoid Kernel
- Polynomial Kernel
