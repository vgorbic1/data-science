## Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

This reduction is applied to linearly separable datasets.

From the **n** independent variables of your dataset,
LDA extracts *p < n* new independent variables that separate the most the classes of the dependent variables.

The fact that the dependent variable is considered makes LDA a supervised feature extraction model.
