## Deep Learning
Deep Learning is the most exciting and powerful branch of Machine Learning. Deep Learning models can be used for a 
variety of complex tasks:
- Artificial Neural Networks for Regression and Classification
- Convolutional Neural Networks for Computer Vision
- Recurrent Neural Networks for Time Series Analysis
- Self Organizing Maps for Feature Extraction
- Deep Boltzmann Machines for Recommendation Systems
- Auto Encoders for Recommendation Systems

Geoffrey Hinton is the godfather of Deep Learning.
