## Deep Learning
Deep Learning is the most exciting and powerful branch of Machine Learning. Deep Learning models can be used for a 
variety of complex tasks:
- Artificial Neural Networks for Regression and Classification
- Convolutional Neural Networks for Computer Vision
- Recurrent Neural Networks for Time Series Analysis
- Self Organizing Maps for Feature Extraction
- Deep Boltzmann Machines for Recommendation Systems
- Auto Encoders for Recommendation Systems

Geoffrey Hinton is the godfather of Deep Learning.

The model of "shallow" learning:

Neuron is a basic building block of a Neural Network.

Gradient Descent (Batch Gradient Descent) is used to adjust weights in a bulck and find the best convex Cost Function fit:

Stochastic Gradient Descent is used to adjust weights in each row and find best non-convex Cost Function fit:
