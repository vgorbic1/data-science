The human brain processes certain images that have a certain features in real life and it classifies it as such.

Yann Lecun is the father of Convolutional Neural Networks. He was a student of Geofrey Hinton.

#### How it works on a very basic level:
Input Image &#x2192; CNN &#x2192; Output Label (Image class)
