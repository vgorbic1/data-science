## Clustering
Clustering is similar to classification, but the basis is different. In Clustering you donâ€™t know what you are looking for, and you are trying to identify some segments or clusters in your data. When you use clustering algorithms on your dataset, unexpected things can suddenly pop up like structures, clusters and groupings you would have never thought of otherwise.

| Clustering Model | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- |
| K-Means | Simple to understand. Works well on small or larege datasets, fast, efficient and performant. | Need to choose the number of clusters. |
| HC | The number of clusters obtained by model | Not appropriate for large datasets |
