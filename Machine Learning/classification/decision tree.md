There are two types of trees under a CART term:
- Regression trees. (for predicting numeric values)
- Classification trees. (for predicting non-numeric values as yes/no, 1 or 0)

Decision tree is much more powerful with other algoritms, such as [Random Forest](https://github.com/vgorbic1/data-science/blob/master/Machine%20Learning/random%20forest.md).
