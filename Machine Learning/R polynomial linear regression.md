## Polynomial Linear Regression with R
Sample [Dataset](https://github.com/vgorbic1/data-science/blob/master/Machine%20Learning/Sample%20Data/Position_Salaries.csv)
1. Set the working directory where the dataset resides.
2. Import the dataset.
3. No need to split data to training and test data for this particular dataset (database is too simple/small).
4. No need for Feature Scaling either.
5. Fit a linear Regression to the dataset. (optional)
6. Fit a polynomial Regression to the dataset.
7. Compare two regressions. (optional)
```r

```
