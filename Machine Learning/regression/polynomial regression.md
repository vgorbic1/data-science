## Polynomial Linear Regression
Altough it is called linear, the shape is not linear, but has a parabolic curve. It is called linear because of coefficients. It may be considered a "special case" of multiple linear regression.
### y = b<sub>0</sub> + b<sub>1</sub>*x<sub>1</sub> + b<sub>2</sub>*x<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> + ... + b<sub>n</sub>*x<sup>2</sup><sub>n</sub>
Where:
- y is a dependend variable
- x are independent variables
- b<sub>0</sub> is a constant
- b<sub>1</sub> - b<sub>n</sub> are coefficients
